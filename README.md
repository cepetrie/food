Requirements: Built a form that uses form validation to allow/require a user to select from each of the following courses, by turn:

1) Appetizer: Require your user to select 1, but no more than 2 appetizers (minimum 3 selections per category)

2) Main course: Require your user to select only 1 main course (minimum 2 selections per category)

3) Sides: Require your user to select 1-3 side dishes (minimum 3 selections per category)

4) Beverage: Require your user to select 1 beverage (minimum 2 selections per category)

5) Dessert: Require your user to select 1 dessert (minimum 2 selections per category)

Categories: Besides allowing the user to make the selections above, the user is presented with 2 categories for each item.  

Show/Hide or Slide Down: Each of the selections made (appetizer, main course, etc.) only show once a category is chosen.  If another category is chosen, the previous category is hiden again.  Only one category per course is shown at a time!

Form items cleared: On hide, the form elements clear from the un-chosen category.  This is so the form doesn't submit form data twice.
